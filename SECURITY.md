## Security Best Practices

To ensure secure usage of the `ChatsAPI` framework:

1. **Keep dependencies up to date**: Regularly update the library and its dependencies to mitigate risks from outdated packages.
2. **Protect your API keys**: When using LLM integrations like OpenAI or Gemini, securely store API keys and avoid hardcoding them in your codebase.
3. **Sandbox testing**: Always test the library in a controlled, sandboxed environment before deploying it to production.
4. **Input sanitization**: Ensure user inputs are properly validated and sanitized to prevent potential injection attacks.
